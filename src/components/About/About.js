                    <p>
                        My love of acrylic painting led me to software development and coding-- I felt a call to build beautiful function in action. Please view my artwork via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jen.emanuele.art/">Instagram</a>).
                     My goal is to build beautiful yet highly functional projects, tools and websites that are user friendly and aesthetically pleasing.  I am also an RN with many years of experience in and out of the hospital. 
                        Outside of painting and coding, I love to spend my free time with my twins, reading, running and doing yoga.
